abstract = {In this paper we propose a modification to Shannon capacity bound in order to facilitate accurate benchmarking of UTRAN Long Term Evolution (LTE). The method is generally applicable to wireless communication systems, while we have used LTE air-interface technology as a case study. We introduces an adjusted Shannon capacity formula, where we take into account the system bandwidth efficiency and the SNR efficiency of LTE. Separating these issues, allows for simplified parameter extraction. We show that the bandwidth efficiency can be calculated based on system parameters, while the SNR efficiency is extracted from detailed link level studies including advanced features of MIMO and frequency domain packet scheduling (FDPS). We then use the adjusted Shannon capacity formula combined with G-factor distributions for macro and micro cell scenarios to predict LTE cell spectral efficiency (SE). Such LTE SE predictions are compared to LTE cell SE results generated by system level simulations. The results show an excellent match of less that 5-10{\%} deviation. {\textcopyright} 2007 IEEE.},

    abstract = {In this paper the coverage and capacity of SigFox, LoRa, GPRS, and NB-IoT is compared using a real site deployment covering 8000 km2 in Northern Denmark. Using the existing Telenor cellular site grid it is shown that the four technologies have more than 99 {\%} outdoor coverage, while GPRS is challenged for indoor coverage. Furthermore, the study analyzes the capacity of the four technologies assuming a traffic growth from 1 to 10 IoT device per user. The conclusion is that the 95 {\%}-tile uplink failure rate for outdoor users is below 5 {\%} for all technologies. For indoor users only NB-IoT provides uplink and downlink connectivity with less than 5 {\%} failure rate, while SigFox is able to provide an unacknowledged uplink data service with about 12 {\%} failure rate. Both GPRS and LoRa struggle to provide sufficient indoor coverage and capacity.},
