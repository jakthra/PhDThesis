Mobile communication systems have over the past two decades, become a foundation for modern society. Communication has always been a fundamental necessity for human society, but the recent years have indeed shown how great of an engineering achievement cellular networks are. The mobile phone has evolved into a device that enables an enormous amount of services. For most people, what goes on behind the scenes of a mobile phone is considered black magic. Most people do not question it as long as it just \emph{works}. However, when it does not work, or \emph{no service} is displayed, the annoyance is more significant than anything. Regardless of the annoyance level reached, these mobile communication services are paramount to modern society. If not only for entertainment but also for essential emergency communication services. As technology evolves, so does mobile communication systems. The development and on-going process of deploying \gls{nr} solutions is the foundation for a multitude of communication services. The capabilities of \gls{nr} are many, one of which is the expected industrial revolution where automatization is in focus. However, first and foremost, to offer increased capacity and coverage. The increased capacity, lower latency and improved energy efficiency are vital properties of \gls{nr}-based networks. These improved capabilities are driven not only by demand but also by necessity. 

\gls{ai} have in recent years been shown to be capable of solving complex problems surpassing human performance in tasks such as image recognition or language translation. These performances have not gone unnoticed and have attracted incredible attention from mainstream media. The models behind these advances are in broad strokes identified by \acrfull{dl}. While modern mobile communication systems may be an incredible feat of engineering, it is still faced with many complex problems of management and optimization. The recent advances in \acrlong{dl} coupled with the increased demand and solutions for mobile communication, sparked the PhD project behind this dissertation. Current mobile communication systems are advanced, sophisticated, and any additions must be selected with patience and deliberation. The adaptability of \acrlong{dl} has been hailed as an essential part in overcoming these problems and a key enabler for future mobile networks. This dissertation seeks to explore the role and feasibility of \gls{ai} solutions in current and future mobile communication systems through novel applications. 

The main limitation of mobile communication networks is the transmission of information over the air using radio waves. The radio environment in mobile communication systems is difficult to characterize due to many complex interactions on both a macroscopic and microscopic level. The fundamental theoretical understanding of radio propagation has been established and can offer insight into this complex and dynamic environment; however, at the cost of extreme computational complexity. To ensure reliable transmission in the current mobile systems, it requires an enormous amount of so-called channel state information. This information is to ensure the right actions are taken when transmitting to and from a user. This amount of information is significant. So significant that it in practice is capable of storing $2^{24}$ channel coefficients per millisecond per operating base station \cite{Studer2018}. The base station is the entity that connects to mobile devices present in the environment. Data quantity is the main driver for \acrlong{dl}-solutions.  By formalizing problems as learning objectives, \acrlong{dl} can be used to obtain correlation, information and insight from otherwise insensible data. The data quantities of the radio environment, coupled with the requirements for \acrlong{dl} defines the areas of contributions within this dissertation.


\section*{Areas of contribution}
The focus of the contributions within this dissertation is on the so-called \emph{physical layer} of mobile communication systems, seen in Fig. \ref{fig:areas_of_contribution}. For any communication system, this layer is associated with the practicalities of transmitting and receiving the raw information over the transmission medium. In the case of mobile communication systems, the transmission medium is foremost considered \emph{the air}.
