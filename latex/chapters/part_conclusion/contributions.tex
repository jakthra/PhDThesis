\chapter{Contributions}\label{ch:contributions}

Throughout this thesis, several applications of Deep Learning in cellular systems have been documented. The focus of the presented methods has primarily been on the physical layer of the cellular domain. I.e. the methods have required data from, and associated with, radio propagation statistics. The use case of Deep Learning dictate large quantities of data which is present when dealing with radio propagation statistics. The large data quantities are basically available for free when operating with current and future mobile communication systems. Generally this is due to the underlying complexity associated with the transmission and reception of radio waves. The many contributions of this thesis is summarized in this chapter. The remainder of the chapter discusses the current and future applications of Deep Learning in cellular and mobile networks, primarily based on the efforts produced throughout the PhD project behind this thesis. The source code for many of the documented methods can be found in a single repository associated with this dissertation \cite{Thrane2020RepositoryLearning}.

\section{Thesis contributions}

The major contributions of this thesis can be reduced to the following very specific items. 

\begin{itemize}
    \item Chapter \ref{ch:channelmodellingbasics}, No path loss performance gain is found using complex ray-tracing compared to existing empirical models.
    \item Chapter \ref{ch:satelliteImages}, Deep Learning can significantly improve path loss estimation for unseen locations
    \item Chapter \ref{ch:satelliteImages}, Geographical Images contain information useful for path loss prediction that can be extracted with supervised learning
    \item Chapter \ref{ch:deepindoor}, Deep indoor propagation characteristic is shown to be determined by a complex combination of geo-statistical features
    \item Chapter \ref{ch:deepindoor}, Deep Learning is identified as an essential tool for engineering features used for modelling Deep Indoor propagation.
    \item Chapter \ref{ch:channel_estimation}, Channel estimation in uplink transmission can significantly be improved by using Deep Learning.
    \item Chapter \ref{ch:channel_q_learning}, Deep Reinforcement Learning can enable autonomous solutions for designing optimum pilot placement in uplink.
\end{itemize}


The contributions can furthermore be discussed in general terms of optimization application. While Deep Learning is a powerful tool, the methodologies associated with the learning procedures require a significant interpretation when discussing the feasibility of the solution. It is thus important to summarize not only the provided gains of the solutions but also the noticeable challenges - especially associated with computational complexity and run-time hereof. Optimization is the act of effectively improving a process without the violation of constraints. In mobile communication networks such constraints are many but primarily related to two items, time and memory. Thus, it is important to outline the contributions from the point of view of applications and the practical constraints of mobile communication systems.

\section{Optimization procedures}
The thesis calls for the optimization of future cellular networks. Thus is is necessary to discuss the optimization properties provided by the proposed Deep Learning methods throughout the thesis. Furthermore, to infer and absorb general knowledge from the documented methods that can contribute to future novel solutions for improving cellular networks.

The contributions can be grouped into the properties of the resulting optimization approach. In cellular networks, and the maintenance of which, the optimization is achievable at many levels. We can group the operational complexity of the major contributions into offline, quasi-real-time and real-time applications. More specifically, the underlying complexity of the contributed Deep Learning-based solutions are feasible for a particular set of optimization procedures. We define offline optimization procedures as the use of algorithms or models where the run-time and availability is not required to be constrained in time. Examples of this can be empirical path loss models for use in the planning phase for cellular base station deployment. Of course it would be nice if the computational complexity is within some timing constraints, as to not delay the planning for too long. Quasi-real-time applications do consider timing constraints, but are not stringent unlike real-time applications and operations. 

For instance, utilizing Deep Learning for path loss estimation as seen in Chapter \ref{ch:satelliteImages} offer accurate predictions in unseen scenario with low data complexity but also a low model complexity. It is expected that autonomous driving and cognitive network is dependent on low complexity models that are accurate. Thus the contribution here is two-fold, 1) an improvement to path loss prediction can be engineered by using Deep Learning and 2) It does not require unfeasible computational complexity to do so. In short, the contributions of Chapter \ref{ch:satelliteImages} is not only related to the obtained accurate path loss estimations but also the application in which such a solution can be utilized. It is believed, and shown, that Deep Learning is capable of enabling future novel solutions requiring high accuracy path loss estimations operating within real-time or at least quasi-real-time constraints. 

Improving channel estimation is a real-time application due to immediate changes to channel statistics. It could be argued that in some cases of stationary users the changes to channel statistics only require quasi-real-time optimization. However, regardless, it is considered a requirement of the optimization procedure that it can be completed in real-time. The contributions of the chapter \ref{ch:channel_estimation} shows that this is to some extend possible but with a few noticeable caveats. Changes in fundamental channel characteristics cause immediate changes in the channel statistics, which is unexplored for the documented deep learning-based channel estimator. The contribution is limited to the initial exploration and performance comparison of the using \gls{dnn} methodologies, of which the performance gain is significant compared to traditional methods. Thus the contribution is limited to the application of channel estimation for stationary or slow moving \glspl{ue}. Additional work is required for analysing the practical feasibility of both trained and untrained \gls{dnn} in channel estimation solutions.

In \ref{ch:channel_q_learning} the area of optimizing channel estimation is attacked from the point of strategically placing pilots to exploit the channel statistics. Unlike the deep channel estimator, the improvements are not gained by improving traditional channel estimators, but rather interacting in such a way with the environment that exploit the observed channel statistics. 


\section{Challenges}
A number of different implementations have been completed and documented throughout this thesis. During the development, implementation and testing of the methods a number of challenges have been identified. These challenges are important contributions to put forward for future development of the proposed methods or related approaches. The practical challenges have been attempted discussed throughout each chapter of this thesis. The result of this discussion is important for identifying and concluding overall challenges for \gls{ml}-based solutions in mobile communication networks.


\subsection{Interpretation}
As identified from chapter \ref{ch:satelliteImages} (See Section \ref{sec:identified_challenges_satellite}) the use of convolutional layers on geographical images is effective for estimating path loss, but are difficult to interpret. Generally, the methods used in wireless communication have been based on the known and overly well-studied techniques. For instance, methods that through mathematics can be proved and fully understood. This transparency is not entirely there yet for \gls{dl}-based solutions \cite{Samek2017ExplainableModels} but must be said to be a  requirement for any technique used in systems such as mobile communication systems to ensure reliability. It is thus important to know when and if given techniques and solutions breaks in order to engineer reliable systems. This challenge is also identified through the methods of Chapter \ref{ch:channel_estimation} and \ref{ch:channel_q_learning}. The introduction of \emph{expert knowledge/model-aid} in chapter \ref{ch:satelliteImages} improves the interpretation properties of the model. The model is no longer tasked with learning the entirety of the problem, but aided with some of the well-known and proven theory. This approach greatly improves the interpretation as the \gls{dl} model and can show important insights into the variability offered by the model for data points not observed during training. The embedding of \emph{expert knowledge} is seen as a essential approach for the feasibility of a \gls{dl}-based  application in future mobile communication systems.

\subsection{Implementation}
As noted by the key findings of Chapter \ref{ch:channel_q_learning} and the use of Deep Reinforcement Learning, a severe bottleneck for future development and research was identified as being related to the core implementation. The implementation challenges were primarily related to the mobile network environment. In order to effectively learn, the environment of interaction needs to be as realistic as possible. Improved implementations are key to more experiments and better hyper-parameters. By reducing the time required for training the \gls{dl}, more time can be spent on evaluating the capabilities of the proposed architecture and the required hyper-parameters. This is effectively intertwined with the challenges of obtaining the best performing model complexity for generalizing the learning problem. The model complexity is adjusted through the use of hyper-parameters. Finding the right hyper-parameters is a time consuming and exhaustive task, and thus an identified challenge that is of increased importance for future \gls{dl}-enabled solutions.

\subsection{Training data}
The majority of the proposed \gls{ml} solutions presented in this thesis have been a \emph{supervised} algorithm, thus where learning the mapping between inputs and outputs have been the learning objective. With the exception of Chapter \ref{ch:channel_q_learning} where Deep Reinforcement Learning is utilized. Supervised solutions suffer from data acquisition, as a training set is required. And more so, a test set is also required to ensure generalization is partly achieved. For some applications, this may be simple to obtain however as seen for the supervised deep channel estimator in Chapter \ref{ch:channel_estimation} it is a massive problem for the practical considerations of such a solution. Deep Reinforcement Learning is a suitable approach if given limited training data, as the problem can still be formalized in a supervised manner. Thus, the identified challenge here is how to effectively determine the practical feasibility of obtaining a training set, as it will determine the usefulness of the learned method. 

\section{Deep Learning in Cellular Networks}

Deep Learning is a powerful tool for optimization and solving complex tasks. As shown by the content of the thesis, such solutions does not necessarily suffer from significant computational complexity. The stringent requirements of time and memory in \gls{lte} and \gls{nr} mobile communication is crucial to abide by. The contributions of this thesis have successfully demonstrated that such systems can coexist to further optimize complex tasks related to the physical layer of mobile communication. Next generation communication systems are faced with even larger lists of constraints and requirements which increases the difficulties of engineering optimized solutions. As found throughout literature, and the content of this thesis - Deep Learning tools are expected to play a large role in engineering future solutions. If not explicitly, then implicitly through automatized learning of relevant features in the massive storage of radio measurement data. A significant magnitude of optimization gains are present in this data source. The design of an effective communication system is ultimately reduced to the fundamental understanding of the propagation channel.

So in general terms, what has been learned by applying Deep Learning to issues related to mobile communication? The complexity of modern cellular system is staggering and will increase with the \emph{necessary} increase in capacity needs. It is shown that complex task associated with radio propagation can be improved through the use of automatized adaptive models such as \gls{dnn}. And furthermore, many computational tasks of computer vision have been shown to be almost directly translatable to the physical layer of cellular systems. The complexity increase of future systems will require novel and solutions for not only improving and optimizing the capacity of such systems, but also in terms of management. It may be that a direct optimization of capacity can introduce unnecessary complexity that is so difficult and complex to manage.

The application of Deep Learning has revolutionized many computational tasks, however, it is yet to revolutionize the area of mobile communication. The potential for major improvements are there, however, it is contingent on a fundamental change in how communication systems work. For now, embedding Deep Learning into existing solutions to test the worth and complexity seems like the correct course of action.
