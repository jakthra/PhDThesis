\chapter{Hyper-parameter logger}

A simple library for controlling machine learning based experiments was created during the project. The module is available for \texttt{python} and can be found at \url{https://pypi.org/project/experimentlogger-jathr/}. The module consists of two primary classes

\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{Environment}
    \item \texttt{ExperimentLogger}
\end{itemize}


The \texttt{Environment} class is used to identify folders for store experiments and results. Each experiment is initialize and constructed using the \texttt{ExperimentLogger} class. Different modes of storage is available, using either a \texttt{mongodb} database or simple \texttt{json} file systems.

The configuration of the \gls{ml} model is assigned as a pythonic dictionary, An example of use are given as below 

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python, basicstyle=\footnotesize, keywordstyle=\color{deepblue}, emphstyle=\color{deepred}, stringstyle=\color{deepgreen}]
    exp = Experiment('file', config=args.__dict__, root_folder='exps/')
    results_dict = dict()
    results_dict['train_loss'] = train_loss
    results_dict['test_loss'] = test_loss
    exp.results = results_dict
    exp.save()
\end{lstlisting}

In this paricular example, the configuration is given to the \texttt{Experiment} class, along with a root folder for storage of the \texttt{json} files. A dictionary of results is defined as two arrays. The resulting output file can be see as below for a single epoch of the model utilizng satellite images as defined in Chapter \ref{ch:satelliteImages}:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python, basicstyle=\footnotesize, keywordstyle=\color{deepblue}, emphstyle=\color{deepred}, stringstyle=\color{deepgreen}]
